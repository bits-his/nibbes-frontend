# Nibbles Kitchen Order Management System - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Hybrid Approach**: Drawing from modern food ordering platforms (Uber Eats, DoorDash) for customer interfaces and enterprise dashboard systems (Toast POS, Square) for staff interfaces. This ensures intuitive customer experience while maintaining operational efficiency for kitchen and management workflows.

**Core Design Principles**:
- Clear visual hierarchy separating customer and operational interfaces
- Quick-scan layouts for kitchen staff to process orders efficiently
- Trust-building elements for customer ordering (menu images, clear pricing)
- Minimal friction in checkout and payment flows

## Typography System

**Font Families**: 
- Primary: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, modern sans-serif for UI elements and body text
- Secondary: Poppins (Google Fonts) - slightly rounded for headings and emphasis

**Type Scale**:
- Hero/Display: text-5xl to text-6xl, font-bold (Poppins)
- Page Headings: text-3xl to text-4xl, font-semibold (Poppins)
